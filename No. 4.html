<h4>
Inputs
</h4> These inputs were only tested using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox">Firefox</a> . Chrome, Chrome Beta, Dolphin, Opera and some other browser do not seem to support the gallery option. Note: the goal was to
show the gallery option on phone browsers. This does also work with UC Browser, however they have there special way to go around this problem..

<h4>
Intents
</h4> I am currently figuring out if it is possible to get a image input by opening an gallery intent.

<a href="geo:0,0?q=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway,+Mountain+View,+California">Open map intent</a>
<a href="intent://scan/#Intent;scheme=zxing;package=com.google.zxing.client.android;end"> Take a QR code with zxing </a>
